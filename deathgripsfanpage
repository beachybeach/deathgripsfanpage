        <h2>About Death Grips</h2>

The group consists of MC Ride (vocals, lyrics), Zach Hill (drums, production), and Andy Morin (keyboards, production). Though he is not the band's frontman, Hill has been credited with being the driving creative force behind the project. Their sound, paired with Ride's aggressive performing style, draws on punk rock, electronic, noise, and industrial styles.</p>
